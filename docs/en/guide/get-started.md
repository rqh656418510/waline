## Importing in HTML (Client)

Make the following settings on your web page:

1. Use CDN to import Waline: `///cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@waline/client`.

1. Create a `<script>` tag and initialize with `Waline()` while passing in the necessary `el` and `serverURL` options.

   - The `el` option is the element used for Waline rendering. You can set a CSS selector in the form of a string or an HTMLElement object.
   - `serverURL` is the link of the server, which you just got.

   ```html:line-numbers
   <head>
     ..
     <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@waline/client"></script>
     ...
   </head>
   <body>
     ...
     <div id="waline"></div>
     <script>
       Waline({
         el: '#waline',
         serverURL: 'https://your-domain.vercel.app',
       });
     </script>
   </body>
   ```

1. The comment service will now run successfully on your website :tada:

## Comment management (Management)
